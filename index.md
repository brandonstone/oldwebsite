# About me

Hello! My name is Brandon Stone. I am a Junior Software Engineering major at Mississippi State University from Memphis, TN. Currently, I am learning about the different types of software development and engineering techniques to enchance my skills. I aspire to graduate in 2018 and work as a Software Eningeer afterwards. I love music, Memphis, Mississippi State, and everything else that is beautiful in the world.
